This was my first project at the monash university for the unit “game programming with c++”. It is just a simple Battleship game with DirectX. I wrote everything by myself, except of the given code. There are still some problems with the given code from the uni - some bugs etc.

#### Used Software ###
Windows 8.1
Visual Studio 2015
Maya 2015


#### DirectXTK ####
I build directxtk by my self, 'cause the object file didn't work for me.
